# Enryption-Decryption-Software
Built this programme because I had no knowledge of c++ libraries that worked with Arduino to encrypt and or decrypt keypad inputs.
  - VERSION #1: made using function, no error handling/fast processing
    - **METHODS:**
      - **createEncryption();** 
        Takes an Array of integers;
      > Example: 
       - int arr[4] = {69, 89, 40, 67};
       - createEncryption(arr);
      
      - **startDecryption();**
        Returns a 2 dementional vector of keys
      
  - VERSION #2: made using Class structure, no error handling/fast processing
