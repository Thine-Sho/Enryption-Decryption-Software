# Enryption-Decryption-Software
Built this programme because I had no knowledge of c++ libraries that worked with Arduino to encrypt and or decrypt keypad inputs.
  VERSION #1: made using function, no error handling/fast processing
    - **METHODS:**
      - createEncryption(); 
      Takes an Array;
      - startDecryption();
      Returns a 2 dementional vector
      of keys
      
  VERSION #2: made using Class structure, no error handling/fast processing
